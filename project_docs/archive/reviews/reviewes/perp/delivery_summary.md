## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why This Matters Now
1. Before semantic layer integration (timing critical)
2. Before hitting production incidents (preventive)
3. Before scaling user base (risk compounds)
4. Before security audit/compliance (requirements)

### Why This Works
1. Prioritized approach (critical first)
2. Detailed implementation (copy-paste ready)
3. Incremental value (benefit per phase)
4. Measurable progress (metrics-driven)

### Why Skip Would Fail
1. Compounding technical debt
2. Exponential incident costs
3. Regulatory compliance issues
4. Semantic layer blocked by instability
